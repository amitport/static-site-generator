# Static site generator

This static site generator is designed to render markdown with LaTex to static HTML pages with as little fuzz as possible. It is explicitly designed to fit my needs, so it will not have support for many features.

Note that the generator is very simple. In particular, it has no concept of a theme. If you want to adapt the look, you should directly modify the HTML and CSS (or the scripts that generate them).

It utilizes [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), and [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX), and a shell script to build the site.


## Example

Make sure you have node and npm installed, then run:

	git clone https://github.com/rubenvannieuwpoort/static-site-generator
	cd static-site-generator
	npm install
	./build


## Configuration

This generator will create a site with just two types of pages. An index page, which contains a list of links to blog entries. This page is generated by the format-index script. The posts are contained in the `posts` folder. They should be in markdown format. Some metadata of the blog posts is specified in the file `post_list`. This file contains four tab-separated columns:
  1. The post title
  2. The filename of the markdown file (contained in the `posts` folder), without the "md" extension.
  3. The date of the blog post, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
  4. A description of the blog post.

This data is read by the `build` script and by `scripts/generate-index`.


## Description of the build process

The `build` script contains the build process. In word, it does the following:

    1. For each line in post_list:
	    run scripts/format-blogpost <TITLE>, save the output to site/posts/<FILENAME>.html
	2. Copy all files from post_files/ to site/posts, and all folders from posts/ to site/posts
	3. Run scripts/format-index and save the output to site/index.html

The files in index_files and post_files will get copied to the file containing the index and blog posts, respectively. This makes it possible to link to these files in the HTML files using relative paths.

The posts should be in markdown format in the 'posts' folder. The filename of a blogpost should be prefixed with a date in the form `yyyy-mm-dd`, and should have the 'md' extension. So a filename should look like: `2019-12-07-my-title`.

To generate the site, simply run `make`. A folder 'site' will be generated, which contains your site. You don't need to run a server to look at the files, so you can just doubleclick index.html to see the result.

Note that to remove the HTML of a blog post, it is necessary to run `make clean && make`, or manually remove the HTML file in site/posts.
